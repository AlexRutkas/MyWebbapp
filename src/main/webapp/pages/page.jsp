<h1>Sonic Forces</h1>
<h2>A new game... with you on lead role!</h2>
<p>Infinite, a captain of Jackal Squad, and Shadow the Hedgehog, were assigned by Rouge the Bat with attacking Arsenal Pyramid.</p>
<p>Eggman, who has just begun coming to terms with all the defeats that Sonic has done to him, learned about the attack of new enemies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Infinite was offered to become the leader of the Eggman Army by Eggman, who had no other choice to do with the captain due to his health problems.</p>
<p>However, Infinite refused to take Eggman's offer in order to protect his squad and his friends.</p>
<p>Later, the Jackal Squad was assigned by Rouge with defending the city from Eggman and his army.</p>
<p>However, all of the squad members but Infinite, were accidentally annihilated by Sonic the Hedgehog, who had come to destroy Eggman's Facility in Mystic Jungle.</p>
<p>Infinite tried exacting revenge on Sonic, only to be dealt a humiliating defeat.</p>
<p>Infuriated by his own weakness, the captain assumed a new identity to switch sides to Eggman and fuse with the finalized Phantom Ruby prototype in order to become stronger.</p>
<p>As things get desperate for the residents and all hope seemed lost, Sonic appears on the scene, having answered Tails' emergency call, and makes short work of the Egg Pawns threatening Tails and several civilians before challenging Dr. Eggman.</p>
<p>Eggman, however, having anticipated letting Sonic defeat him, and told him his severe health problems - to protect himself from horrible consequences, he had chosen a rightful heir and a leader of his army.</p>
<p>As Sonic charges at Eggman, the doctor summons his allies, who block Sonic from reaching Eggman in his Egg Mobile.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Sonic sees that Eggman's allies are none other than Shadow, Metal Sonic, Zavok, and Chaos.</p>
<p>Among the familiar faces is also Infinite, who had joined Eggman army and became a leader.</p>
<p>Sonic tries to fight them, but is overwhelmed and easily thrashed by Infinite's mysterious power as well as his allies.</p>
<p>Tails, unable to help or figure out Infinite's new power, could only watch as Sonic gets defeated.</p>
<p>With the world believing Sonic to be dead, Eggman and his forces quickly take over the world. Using Infinite's power, the Eggman Empire manages to conquer over 99% of the planet over the course of six months, with only but a few isolated areas still free from their control.</p>
<p>All hope is not lost however, as those among Sonic's friends who managed to escape Eggman's invasion decide to continue the fight.</p>
<p>Together, they form a rag-tag team called the Resistance to combat Eggman's forces, with Knuckles the Echidna as their commander.</p>
<p>Other members include Amy Rose, Team Chaotix, Rouge the Bat and Silver the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>Excluded from the Resistance is Tails, who vanished after Sonic's disappearance, having become distraught over his apparent demise.</p>
<p>Despiponse to the Resistance's rescue attempt, however, the Resistance head to the Death Egg.</p>
<p>Once onboard, the Rookie's choice of route leaves him as the only one who can reach Sonic.</p>
<p>However, Rookie learns from Infinite that Sonic is being held as prisoner in the heart of Eggman Empire Fortress.</p>
<p>After the mission failure, Rookie heads to Mystic Jungle to help Silver, who is being attacked by Infinite.</p>
<p>Although Infinite has the upper hand in their clash, Silver manages to make him drop the Phantom Ruby prototype.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tails and Classic Sonic continue their adventure to stop Eggman, hoping to end the war by defeating the doctor and discover the way to get Classic Sonic back home, and soon find Eggman talking with Infinite about their schemes.</p>
<p>By spying on them, the duo not only learns that Sonic is alive, but also learn that the source of Infinite's power comes from Phantom Ruby, whose defective prototypes have all been destroyed by Infinite to keep them from interfering with Eggman's plans.</p>
<p>After the villains' meeting is dismissed upon the notion that the Resistance and the world will soon fall to the Eggman Empire, Classic Sonic emerges from hiding and takes out Eggman and the machines he uses against him, including the Egg Dragoon.</p>
<p>Despite this, the doctor still gloats to Tails and Classic Sonic that the Resistance will be wiped out by his master plan in just three days.</p>
<p>Before Tails can ask more about it however, Eggman makes his escape.</p>
<p>Having helped rescue some civilians in the meantime, the Rookie is sent to check out some readings in Mystic Jungle.</p>
<p>There, he finds Infinite's dropped Phantom Ruby prototype, along with Classic Sonic and Tails.</p>
<p>After that, Classic Sonic and Tails unite with the Resistance and relay what they learned.</p>
<p>Rookie soon after heads to Sunset Heights to find Shadow, who is leading an attack on the City.</p>
<p>Shadow then reveals that the Shadow following Eggman was a virtual reality copy created by Infinite, as are the other villains serving him, meaning the size of Eggman's army is limitless.</p>
<p>Knuckles soon after launches a massive attack meant to seize Eggman's undermanned headquarters, Metropolis, only for Infinite to foil the attack and wipe out 80% of the Resistance's army with the Phantom Ruby, forcing the remaining troops to retreat before the Resistance is completely annihilated.</p>
